description: I had the opportunity to collaborate with a U.S. client, Beneufit (https://beneufit.com/about-us), on a notable project focused on the implementation of a comprehensive solution for detecting Cow Milk Allergy (CMA) among infants. This endeavor involved the proficient application of diverse machine learning techniques. Throughout the course of this engagement, I closely collaborated with esteemed pediatricians of high repute, undertaking in-depth analysis, fine-tuning, and enhancement of the machine learning models. I am delighted to report that the project was concluded successfully, resulting in a letter of recommendation being graciously provided in acknowledgment of my contributions.
