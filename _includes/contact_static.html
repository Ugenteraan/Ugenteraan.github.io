          Over the course of my adventurous 7-year journey in machine learning and software engineering, I've donned different hatsâ€”from a machine learning engineer to senior roles, and even a thrilling stint as a Chief Technology Officer. On top of that, I'm currently having a blast as a machine learning mentor for a fantastic local programming community. There, I get to unleash my teaching prowess, imparting software engineering and machine learning wisdom to bright university students, fresh graduates, and passionate programmers.
